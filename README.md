<!-- This is my README file.


Break the project down into different components (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!

Run Once:
1. Populate Board
2. Add Event Listener
3. Initialise state variables (global variables)

Run Every time:
1. User Click (input from player 1 or 2)
2. Select DOM element when user clicks
3. Populate either "X" or "O" html text content.
4. Has someone won? Check win validation (16 possible ways to win for both X and O)
    - True - 1. Congrats player who won
             2. Reset Game (clear board and restart game to step 1.)
    - False - 1. Wait for additional user click (back to step 1.) -->

Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems

A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

MDN documentation was used where methods were unclear or unfamiliar.
